<h3>Offline Alternatives</h3> 

Direct meeeting with the faculty or student and contact with a call or mails cangive more appropriate result without any overlappings. But this indulge in more manual work to know the apt timings and to contact everytime when their is a overlapping or change in scheduling. Our website reduces the manual work and inconvenience by showing the appropriate timings of student and faculty. 

<h3>Online Alternatives</h3>

A good alternative for scheduling plans is Google Calender. In this we can make our plans effectively. But not many of the faculty use it. It creates inconvience when they have a change in plan after the meeting is fixed. So our website provides a feature that whenever a faculty makes a change, the information is sent to others and they again can fix it accordingly to their relevant timings. 

<h3>Our Magnet Content</h3>

2. Our site will also be synced with the google calender if the faculty is using it.

Searching and browsing capabilities: All the users can search and browse for theavailability of others. 

Delegated moderation:  Both the faculty and student can give their privilage to the secretary to edit their schedulings.

Removing bozos: Faculty can stop notifications from the e-mail and can directly see the changes from the website.
